## [wippo](https://wippo.app)

**wippo** is a construction site management software developed by [Gioele Buonadonna](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gioelebuonadonna/). Trysil is part of its technology stack — more details on **wippo** [Technology](https://wippo.app/tecnologia.html) page.

*"We use Trysil as our ORM for the **[wippo](https://wippo.app)** construction site management platform. It handles all database interactions, JSON serialization/deserialization for our data models, and powers the HTTP API layer for our REST service — making it central to the entire back-end architecture."*
